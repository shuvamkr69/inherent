"""Repo-level guard: the `Conventions` merge-gate workflow shape.

`.github/workflows/conventions.yml` is a required-status-check workflow (its
single job is named exactly `Conventions`, which becomes a required check
context on `main`). Two behaviors must hold for it to do its job as a merge
gate without becoming a source of false-positive blocks:

- it must trigger on label changes too (`labeled`/`unlabeled`), not just
  code pushes, so applying a skip label re-evaluates the gate without a new
  commit;
- each gate must be skippable via its own label (`no-changelog`,
  `no-docs-needed`) so an intentionally-exempt PR is not stuck.

Most of these tests pin the YAML text rather than executing the workflow
(this repo has no local GitHub Actions runner), matching the pattern in
`tests/test_integration_workflow_guards.py`. The gate *scripts* themselves
are pure bash over a `changed.txt` file list, though, so those are extracted
and actually executed against synthetic file lists -- pinning the text of a
`grep` pattern proves the pattern is spelled a certain way, not that it
classifies a real PR's diff correctly.
