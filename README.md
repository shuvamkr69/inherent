Build your private company brain.

Inherent is the backend for turning company knowledge into something AI systems can actually query.

You connect sources — plain text, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, source code, and more (see the full [supported file types](docs/reference/file-types.md) list). Inherent extracts the content, chunks it, generates embeddings, stores it, and exposes retrieval over REST and MCP-friendly patterns.

In practical terms, this repository is the ingestion, indexing, storage, and retrieval layer of a private RAG system.

## About

Inherent is for teams that want their agents to answer from company context instead of guessing from general model knowledge.

It gives you:

- a document ingestion pipeline
- chunking and embedding generation
- persistent storage for documents and chunks
- vector-backed search over indexed content
- an API layer for retrieving relevant results

## Why Use It

- Bring your own documents: ingest plain text, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, source code, and more — see the full [supported file types](docs/reference/file-types.md) list (PNG images are read via OCR, which requires the ingestion service's optional `ocr` extra and the `tesseract` system binary).
- Run locally: the repo ships with a Compose stack for the required databases and supporting services.
- Separate ingestion from retrieval: one service writes and indexes data, another serves search requests.
- Build on standard components: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Weaviate, Temporal, Redis/Valkey, and S3-compatible storage.

## The Pitch

- Your AI stops answering in the abstract and starts answering from your actual docs.
- Retrieval is structured, repeatable, and citeable instead of relying on prompt copy-paste.
- You keep a clean separation between data ingestion, indexing, and query serving.
- The stack is understandable and self-hostable instead of being a black-box hosted dependency.

## Key Features

- Multi-format ingestion — plain text, Markdown, PDF, DOCX, source code, and more; see the full [supported file types](docs/reference/file-types.md) list (PNG images via OCR, which requires the optional `ocr` extra plus the `tesseract` system binary)
- Chunking and embedding generation for semantic retrieval
- PostgreSQL as structured storage for documents and chunks
- Weaviate as vector index for similarity search
- REST API for search, document listing, chunk access, and context retrieval
- Traffic-mined retrieval evals — turn real search traffic and agent feedback into a labeled eval set, then score recall/MRR/nDCG across keyword, semantic, and hybrid modes on your own corpus, no golden-set authoring required
- Local-first developer setup with Docker Compose

### Retrieval Quality Baseline

Retrieval quality is a CI contract, not a claim. The numbers below are the
committed baseline in
[`retrieval_baseline.json`](services/inh-public-api-svc/tests/evals/corpus/retrieval_baseline.json),
measured against the golden corpus on the full Compose stack. They are an
enforced **floor**: any per-mode metric regressing more than `0.02` below them
fails the build, and a green run on `main` ratchets them up (never down), so
each value is the best score that mode has sustained.

<!-- retrieval-baseline:start -->
<!-- Generated from services/inh-public-api-svc/tests/evals/corpus/retrieval_baseline.json by tests/evals/render_baseline_table.py — do not edit by hand. The eval-baseline-ratchet job regenerates it whenever the baseline moves. -->

| Mode | Recall@5 | MRR | nDCG@5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hybrid | 0.885 | 0.795 | 0.738 |
| Keyword | 0.885 | 0.782 | 0.717 |
| Semantic | 0.885 | 0.705 | 0.706 |
<!-- retrieval-baseline:end -->

Run-over-run scores are appended to
[`retrieval_history.jsonl`](services/inh-public-api-svc/tests/evals/corpus/retrieval_history.jsonl).
See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md#retrieval-eval-gate-baseline-ratchet-and-trend-history-139)
for the gate, the absolute-floor backstop, and how to run the evals locally.

## What's In The Repo

- an ingestion service that processes and indexes documents
- a public API service that searches and returns document content
- a Docker Compose stack for running the databases and supporting services locally
- tests and service-level Python projects for development

## How It Works

The repository is split into two main services:

- `inh-ingestion-svc` owns document processing. It consumes upload events from Redis/Valkey, runs Temporal workflows, extracts and chunks content, generates embeddings through Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference, and writes to PostgreSQL and Weaviate.
- `inh-public-api-svc` provides a customer-facing REST API over indexed content. It reads from PostgreSQL and Weaviate, can publish upload events for ingestion, and also supports an MCP server when launched in `mcp` mode.

Local development uses Docker Compose for the supporting infrastructure:

- PostgreSQL (v15)
- MongoDB
- Weaviate
- Valkey
- S3-compatible object storage via `s3rver`
- Temporal and Temporal UI
- Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference

## Typical Flow

From a user perspective: you upload a file, Inherent processes it in the background, and it becomes searchable. Here is what happens under the hood:

1. A document is uploaded or queued for ingestion.
2. The ingestion service extracts text and splits it into chunks.
3. Embeddings are generated for those chunks.
4. Metadata and chunks are stored in PostgreSQL and Weaviate.
5. The public API searches the indexed content and returns relevant passages.

## First API Call

Once the stack is running, you can verify the public API is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18000/health
```

You can also verify the ingestion API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18002/health
```

To trigger ingestion manually in a local setup (the public API handles this automatically when you upload — this direct call is for re-ingestion or debugging):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18002/ingest \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-ingestion-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_id": "doc_001",
    "workspace_id": "ws_001",
    "user_id": "user_001",
    "filename": "report.pdf",
    "original_filename": "report.pdf",
    "content_type": "application/pdf",
    "size_bytes": 102400,
    "storage_backend": "s3",
    "storage_path": "workspaces/ws_001/report.pdf"
  }'
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- `uv`

## Quickstart

From a fresh checkout, one command gets you a working local stack:

```bash
make quickstart
```

This creates `.env`, installs both services, starts the Compose stack and waits
for it to be healthy, bootstraps a local dev workspace and API key, checks
readiness, and prints the next steps.

Prefer the individual steps? They are still available:

```bash
make setup      # create .env + install both services
make validate   # validate local env settings
make dev        # start the stack and bootstrap the dev workspace/key
make health     # check API health endpoints
```

`make bootstrap` (run by `quickstart` and `dev`) is **local/dev only**. It
creates dev workspaces and API keys in **both** the PostgreSQL `api_keys` table
and the MongoDB `workspaces` collection — the two control-plane records the
protected API needs before any upload or search call works. It is safe to
re-run. Two principals are seeded: `ink_dev_local_key_001` in `ws_local_001`
(the identity every example uses) and `ink_dev_local_key_002` in `ws_local_002`,
a **separate owner** that the tenancy isolation E2E needs in order to prove one
tenant cannot reach another's content. The second principal is seeded only when
`API_KEY` is the local default (as it is here) or `SEED_PRINCIPAL_B=1` is set —
running the script against a real deployment with your own `API_KEY` never
plants the well-known second key.

Follow [Getting Started Locally](docs/getting-started/local.md) to upload a
sample document, wait for ingestion, search indexed content, inspect logs, and
reset your local stack. The [docs index](docs/README.md) is organized for
agent-first discovery.

### Checkout-Free CLI

Install the CLI when you want to run Inherent from published images without a
repository checkout:

```bash
pip install inherent
inherent up
inherent whoami
inherent docs upload docs/examples/sample-documents/sample.txt
inherent search "what retrieval modes does Inherent support"
```

`inherent up` extracts the bundled release Compose file, starts the local stack,
runs the one-shot `bootstrap` service, and saves the local API key in
`~/.inherent/config.toml`. Set `INHERENT_URL` and `INHERENT_API_KEY` to point
read commands at an existing deployment instead.

## Run from published images (no build)

If you just want to *use* Inherent rather than develop it, you don't need to
clone the repo or build anything. The two custom services are published to the
GitHub Container Registry and the rest of the stack pulls upstream OSS images.

```bash
# 1. Grab the release Compose file (the only file you need)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inherent-prime/inherent/main/docker-compose.release.yml

# 2. Start the whole stack from published images (pin a version if you like)
INHERENT_VERSION=latest docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d

# 3. Seed a local dev workspace + API key (one-time; needs no checkout —
#    the script only talks to the running containers via `docker exec`).
#    Override API_KEY with your own `ink_...` value on anything reachable
#    from outside your machine; doing so also skips the well-known second
#    (tenancy-test) key.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inherent-prime/inherent/main/scripts/dev/bootstrap.sh
PG_CONTAINER=inherent-oss-postgres MONGO_CONTAINER=inherent-oss-mongodb \
  bash bootstrap.sh
```

If you use the CLI-managed release stack, run the in-image bootstrap service
instead of downloading the script:

```bash
docker compose --profile bootstrap run --rm bootstrap
```

The stack initializes the database automatically: an init container runs the
ingestion image in `SERVICE_MODE=migrate`, applying the SQL migrations baked
into the image (idempotent and non-destructive — safe to restart). The same
[Local Endpoints](#local-endpoints) and [Local Smoke Test](#local-smoke-test)
below apply.

Notes:

- Images are public (`ghcr.io/inherent-prime/ingestion-svc` and
  `…/public-api-svc`) — no registry login is needed to pull.
- Override the source with `INHERENT_REGISTRY` / `INHERENT_VERSION` env vars.
- The embedding service (`text-embeddings-inference`) is **amd64-only**; on
  Apple Silicon / arm64 it runs under emulation (slower first start). Run the
  full stack on an amd64 host for production-like performance.
- The seeded `ink_dev_local_key_001` is a **dev convenience** — create your own
  workspace and API keys before exposing the stack to anything real.

This release stack is a zero-setup **demo**. Before you point real users or data
at it, work through [Taking Inherent to Production](docs/deploy/production.md) —
real object storage, MongoDB auth, TLS, `ENVIRONMENT=production`, the event-queue
eviction policy, and backups.

## Local Smoke Test

After `make dev` succeeds, run these commands to verify the full document path
works end-to-end:

```bash
export API_BASE="http://localhost:18000"
export API_KEY="ink_dev_local_key_001"
export WORKSPACE_ID="ws_local_001"

# 1. Upload a sample document
curl -s -X POST "$API_BASE/v1/documents" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: $WORKSPACE_ID" \
  -F "file=@docs/examples/sample-documents/sample.txt;type=text/plain" \
  | tee /tmp/inherent-upload.json | jq .

export DOC_ID="$(jq -r .document_id /tmp/inherent-upload.json)"

# 2. Poll until status is "processed" (re-run until you see "processed")
curl -s "$API_BASE/v1/documents/$DOC_ID" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: $WORKSPACE_ID" | jq .status

# 3. Search the indexed document
curl -s -X POST "$API_BASE/v1/search" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: $WORKSPACE_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"what retrieval modes does Inherent support","limit":3}' | jq .
```

A non-empty `results` array in the search response confirms the full path is
healthy. See [Getting Started Locally](docs/getting-started/local.md) for the
complete walkthrough and per-service troubleshooting.

## Repository Layout

### `services/inh-ingestion-svc`

- Runs in `worker` mode by default in Compose.
- Starts a Temporal worker, subscribes to MQ events, and exposes an HTTP API when `INGESTION_API_KEY` is set.
- Owns writes to PostgreSQL and Weaviate.

See [services/inh-ingestion-svc/Readme.md](services/inh-ingestion-svc/Readme.md) for service-specific commands and API details.

### `services/inh-public-api-svc`

- Runs in `both` mode in Compose, which currently serves the REST API path.
- Supports standalone `api`, `mcp`, and `both` modes from the Python entrypoint.
- Reads indexed data from PostgreSQL and Weaviate and can enqueue document upload notifications for ingestion.

See [services/inh-public-api-svc/Readme.md](services/inh-public-api-svc/Readme.md) for service-specific commands and endpoint details.

## Development

Each service is maintained as its own Python project. From the repository root,
use Makefile targets for the common checks:

```bash
make lint
make format-check
make test
```

Run the full local validation suite with:

```bash
make check
```

You can also run service-specific commands directly:

```bash
cd services/inh-ingestion-svc
uv sync --extra dev --group dev
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run black --check src tests
uv run pytest
```

```bash
cd services/inh-public-api-svc
uv sync --extra dev --group dev
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run black --check src tests
uv run mypy src
uv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src
uv run pytest
```

Repository-wide contribution guidance lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap and Architecture

Inherent is an **agent memory substrate** — a permission-aware, citeable,
freshness-aware retrieval layer that an organization's agents query
continuously. The product boundary, guarantees, and non-goals are defined in
[ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-agent-memory-substrate.md). The milestone delivery plan
mapping the issue backlog to that boundary lives in the
[org-readiness requirements](docs/maintainers/org-readiness-requirements.md).
